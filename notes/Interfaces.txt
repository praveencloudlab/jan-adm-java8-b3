Interfaces
==================
1.intrface is a method specifecation which contains zero or more abstract
  meethods.
2.interfaces can have concrete methods. it can have only abstract methods
3.by default every method in the interface is 'public and abstract'
4.by defaukt every variable in the interface is 'public static and final'
5.Any sub classes of an interface must override all the abstract methods
  of an interface.
6.If any sub class an interface  is not overriding any of abstrac method
  then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
- interface  can not instanciated. We can;t create an object to an 
  interface class. But we can create a reference of it.
- The reference of an interface can hold all its sub class objets.

notes
======
1.class can extends to another class
2.class can not extends more than one class at a time
3.class can implements an interface
4.class can implements more than one interface at a time
5.interface can extends to another interface
6.interface can not implements another interface
7.interface can extends more than one interface at a time
8.interfaces and abstract classes must not defined both as final

	final mthods can not overrriden in the sub classes
	final variables act like const
	final class can not be sub classed
