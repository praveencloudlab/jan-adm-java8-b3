   ==========================
   Sub class having only one super class.

   2.multiple inheritanc
   ========================
   Sub class having more than 1 super classes


    Notes
    ==========
    1.super class obejct can hold / store all its sub class obejcts
    	-> so that objection can be achieved.
    2. the super class object can be used to access all the methods of
       super class and overriden methods of sub class
    3. the super class object can not be used to aceess the individual
       methods (a method which defined in sub class and not defined in
       super class) of a sub class.
