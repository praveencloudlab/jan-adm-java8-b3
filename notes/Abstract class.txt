Abstract class
==================

- Abstract class is a method specification which contains zero or more  abstract methods and concrete methods
- abstract methods do not have implementation of methods. only declaration
- concraeme methods have implementaion of method
- Any sub classes of an abstract class must override all the abstract methods
  of an abstract class.
- If any sub class an abstract class is not overriding anyone of abstrac method
  then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
- abstract class can not instanciated. We can;t create an object to an 
  abstract class. But we can create a reference of it.
- The reference of an abstract class ca hold all its sub class objets.


 Tight coupling
 ====================

  A, B
  A is testing (A class still writing the main business logic)
  B is testing (testing is done). B is sub class A 



  Loose coupling
  =================
